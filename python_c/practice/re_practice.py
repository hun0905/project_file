Finding a restaurant to please a large group can be tricky. Thankfully, there are plenty of places all around the city offering solid options for a group dinner that won’t blow a budget or have very tight menu constrictions. Whether for a birthday, work gathering, baby shower, or graduation, here is a list of restaurants perfect for dining with a group — from Korean barbecue with a karaoke finish to taco- and margarita-fueled feasts.

Note: This is an updated version of a map originally published in 2016.

Note: Restaurants on this map are listed geographically.

Dry pot is seemingly infinitely customizable, and Málà Project near Bryant Park allows each diner to make their own version, or a few that the group can share. Throw in ingredients such as chicken thigh, pork belly, prawn, tofu skin, rice cakes, bok choy, or taro, and choose a spice level that everyone can handle. Don’t miss apps like pig ear in chile oil, dandan noodles, and husband & wife lung and tripe slices. This restaurant is particularly good for adhering to various dietary restrictions, like for vegetarians or pescatarians. Groups of seven or more can call to reserve; parties of 12 or more require a prix fixe menu. There’s also an East Village location.

Peter Luger is probably the most quintessential version of a New York City steakhouse. The South Williamsburg restaurant has drawn people from across the five boroughs since it opened in 1887, and some say it’s the best version of a steakhouse in the world, despite recent disputes. The dry-aged porterhouse, which arrives with a sizzle, is the flagship dish, and the bacon and lunch-only burger are famously charming, too. Reservations for up to 10 people are available on Resy.

Sometimes there’s no planning ahead with large groups, and when that’s the case, Hometown is the move. The massive barbecue restaurant has ample seating for its eclectic menu of juicy brisket, gonzo beef ribs, pulled pork tacos, lamb belly banh mi, and other meaty options. Vegetarians can cobble together a respectable meal from the sides, and there’s also often live music to serve as entertainment. Anticipate long lines at peak times.

Call ahead for a group reservation at Chuan Tian Xia, one of the most impressive new Sichuan restaurants in town. A space with vibrant murals and big wooden tables set a lively scene for huge portions that will be better suited for sharing with a crew. Go for one of the whole fish, and supplement it with a spicy cauliflower dish in a woke. But go for more than one order of the chile wontons, which are called Chengdu Dragon Reading Hands on the menu. There’s beer and wine, as well as pitchers of fresh juice.
